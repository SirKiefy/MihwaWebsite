# 미화 · Mihwa

An album in ink for Mihwa. The whole site is one sheet of hanji paper. Every photo of her is repainted as a Korean ink painting (수묵화), and ink spreads into each part of the page as you scroll to it.

| Leaf | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| **미화 · her portrait** | Her photo, repainted in ink, inside an ink bloom. A GPU fluid simulation carries ink through the water around her: move the cursor or a finger to stir it, click to drop more. |
| **초상 · portraits** | Her photos on an eight-panel folding screen (병풍) with indigo silk mounts. It unfolds as you scroll. Hover a panel and her real colours seep back into the ink. Click to open it. |
| **생각 · in her words** | Things she says, set in brush lettering with a seal each. |
| **추억 · best memories** | A handscroll that unrolls as you scroll, with each memory painted on a fan. |
| **길 · her path** | Bachelor's → Master's → diplomacy → human rights & NGOs → fashion, joined by one brush stroke that zigzags between the seals. |
| **멋 · her style** | Her colours, pulled from her photos and ground like pigments into little dishes. Each gets a traditional Korean colour name. Beside them is a card about her. |
| **두 집 · two homes** | An ink globe with a red thread between Seoul and Paris, plus live clocks for both cities. |
| **Instagram** | Her handle, bio and a 3×3 grid (ink first, colour on hover), linking to [@mulnaengmyeonn](https://www.instagram.com/mulnaengmyeonn/). |
| **편지 · a letter** | A personal note, sealed with a 美花 stamp. |

Everything is in **English, French and Korean** (toggle at the top right). Sound is off by default. The button next to the languages turns on soft gayageum plucks.

## ✎ Make it hers

Everything about her lives in **`js/her.js`**:

- **`PHOTOS`**: put image files in `photos/` and write each name as `src: 'photos/01.jpg'` (JPG or PNG, about 1600 px on the long side). Rewrite the captions to fit each photo. An empty `src` shows a soft placeholder portrait.
- **`heroPhoto`**: which photo is painted at the top.
- **`THOUGHTS`**: her words. The four there now are *examples* (marked `example: true`). Replace them with things she actually says.
- **`MEMORIES`**: your best memories together, each with a photo (`photo` is its index in `PHOTOS`), an optional date in `when`, a title and a few lines. These are *examples* too.
- **`PATH`**: her path, from now to where she's going.
- **`bio`** and **`notes`**: the short lines about her.
- **`LETTER`**: the letter at the end. Write your own words there.

Every text has an English (`en`), French (`fr`) and Korean (`ko`) version.

The ink paintings are made in the browser from whatever photos you add, so nothing needs to be prepared by hand.

## Run it locally

It is a static site with no build step:

```bash
npx serve .
# or
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open <http://localhost:8080>. Opening `index.html` directly from disk won't work, because browsers block ES modules on `file://`.

## Publish it

`.github/workflows/pages.yml` deploys the site to **GitHub Pages** on every push to `main`. Enable it once under **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions**.

If the repository is public, her photos will be public too.

## How it's made

- **Photo → ink painting** (`js/fx/inkify.js`): a Kuwahara filter to flatten the photo into brush-sized patches, banded ink washes with noisy edges, pigment pooling where washes dry, difference-of-Gaussians brush lines with dry-brush breaks, granulation and bleed, all on hanji.
- **The sheet of hanji** (`js/fx/inkfield.js`): one WebGL2 layer behind the page paints the paper and every mark on it (blooms, ensō circles, brush strokes and misty mountain ridges). Marks are anchored to `<i class="ink">` elements in the layout and paint themselves in when they scroll into view.
- **Ink hero** (`js/fx/fluid.js`): a stable-fluids simulation (advection, vorticity confinement, pressure projection), rendered as ink in water.
- **Folding screen** (`js/fx/screen.js`): three.js with custom shaders for the silk mount, the painting, the colour wash on hover and the brush captions.
- **Pigments** (`js/fx/palette.js`): k-means over her photos, matched to traditional colour names in CIE Lab.
- **Globe**: Natural Earth 1:50m coastlines (public domain) in an ink-wash shader.
- Every canvas only runs while it's on screen. The site respects `prefers-reduced-motion`, works with keyboard and touch, and falls back gracefully without WebGL.
